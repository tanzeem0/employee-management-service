Employee Management Backend Service
This repository contains a backend service for managing employee information, built with Spring Boot. It provides a RESTful API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records, including partial updates. The service is designed for simplicity and ease of use, leveraging Spring Data JPA for data persistence and H2 Database for in-memory data storage, making it ideal for development and testing.

Features
RESTful API: Exposes endpoints for managing employee data.

CRUD Operations: Full support for creating, retrieving, updating (including partial updates), and deleting employee records.

Data Persistence: Uses Spring Data JPA for seamless interaction with the database.

In-Memory Database: Configured with H2 Database for quick setup and development.

Swagger UI: Interactive API documentation for easy testing and understanding of endpoints.

Validation: Basic validation for incoming data.

Technologies Used
Java 17+: The core programming language.

Spring Boot 3.x: Framework for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications.

Spring Web: For building RESTful APIs.

Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access with JPA repositories.

Spring Validation: For data validation.

H2 Database: An in-memory relational database for development and testing.

Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code (e.g., getters, setters, constructors).

ModelMapper: Object mapping library for DTO-to-Entity and Entity-to-DTO conversions.

Swagger UI (Springdoc-OpenAPI): Generates interactive API documentation.

Maven: Dependency management and build automation tool.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher

Maven 3.6.0 or higher

Git

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-management-service.git
cd employee-management-service

(Replace yourusername with your actual GitHub username if you've already pushed it)

Build the project with Maven:

mvn clean install

Running the Application
You can run the Spring Boot application in a few ways:

Using Maven:

mvn spring-boot:run

Running the JAR file:
After building, a JAR file will be created in the target/ directory.

java -jar target/employee-management-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

(Adjust the JAR name if your pom.xml version is different)

The application will start on port 8080 by default.

API Documentation (Swagger UI)
Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) at:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

This interface allows you to:

View all available API endpoints.

Understand request and response schemas.

Test endpoints directly from your browser.

Database Access (H2 Console)
Since an H2 in-memory database is used, you can access its console to view the data:

http://localhost:8080/h2-console

When prompted for credentials:

JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:employeedb (This is the default URL configured in application.properties)

User Name: sa

Password: (Leave blank)

API Endpoints (Examples)
Here are some example endpoints you can interact with:

POST /api/employees - Create a new employee

GET /api/employees - Get all employees

GET /api/employees/{id} - Get an employee by ID

PUT /api/employees/{id} - Update an existing employee (full replacement)

PATCH /api/employees/{id} - Partially update an existing employee

DELETE /api/employees/{id} - Delete an employee by ID

Refer to the Swagger UI for detailed request/response bodies and parameters.
