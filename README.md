### Employee Management Backend Service
This repository contains a backend service for managing employee information, built with Spring Boot. It provides a RESTful API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records, including partial updates. The service is designed for simplicity and ease of use, leveraging Spring Data JPA for data persistence and H2 Database for in-memory data storage, making it ideal for development and testing.
