Employee Management Backend Service
This repository contains a backend service for managing employee information, built with Spring Boot. It provides a RESTful API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records, including partial updates. The service is designed for simplicity and ease of use, leveraging Spring Data JPA for data persistence and H2 Database for in-memory data storage, making it ideal for development and testing.FeaturesRESTful API: Exposes endpoints for managing employee data.CRUD Operations: Full support for creating, retrieving, updating (including partial updates), and deleting employee records.Data Persistence: Uses Spring Data JPA for seamless interaction with the database.In-Memory Database: Configured with H2 Database for quick setup and development.Swagger UI: Interactive API documentation for easy testing and understanding of endpoints.Validation: Basic validation for incoming data.Technologies UsedJava 17+: The core programming language.Spring Boot 3.x: Framework for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications.Spring Web: For building RESTful APIs.Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access with JPA repositories.Spring Validation: For data validation.H2 Database: An in-memory relational database for development and testing.Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code (e.g., getters, setters, constructors).ModelMapper: Object mapping library for DTO-to-Entity and Entity-to-DTO conversions.Swagger UI (Springdoc-OpenAPI): Generates interactive API documentation.Maven: Dependency management and build automation tool.Getting StartedThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.PrerequisitesJava Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higherMaven 3.6.0 or higherGitInstallationClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-management-service.git
